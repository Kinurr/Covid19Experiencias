## What is it?

With to the ongoing pandemic arises a need to create a support network that respects the social distancing measures in effect. As such, the main goal of this project is to share the experiences of various users, be they of worry, joy or coping strategies and through them build a social hub for psychological help and well-being. 

This sharing should be done through the publication of posts which can be commented, liked and disliked by other users. Comments should be on-topic and straightforward.
